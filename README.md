# C++ training
This repo is only for me to remember my codes. You can do whatever you want with them. The files are named in a strange way because i'm kinda bad at giving name to files. They won't give you so much but if you want to know how to work and remember intermiddiate and advanced stuff in C++ then you are at right place to copy and paste. Do whatever you want with the codes.
